<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ol>
<li>‚¨áÔ∏è An interface called <code>ToSic.Sxc.DataSources.IBlockInstance</code> was removed since it was identical to <code>ToSic.Eav.DataSource.IDataSource</code> and should not be used anywhere.</li>
<li>‚¨áÔ∏è Core objects like Entity, Attribute etc. were changed to <code>record</code> - this would only affect you if you inherited from them</li>
<li>‚¨áÔ∏è Cleanup internal APIs on an internal interface <code>IEntityLight</code> which is not public. Properties: <code>Title</code>, <code>Attributes</code> and <code>this[...]</code></li>
<li>‚ö†Ô∏è Enhancement in the <code>Pages</code> DataSource - property renames <code>Visible</code> to <code>IsNavigation</code> and <code>Clickable</code> to <code>IsClickable</code></li>
<li>‚ö†Ô∏è Enhancement to the <code>Roles</code> DataSource - renamed to <code>UserRoles</code> - breaking change!</li>
<li>‚ö†Ô∏è Renamed the system query <code>System.Roles</code> to <code>System.UserRoles</code> - breaking change!</li>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Minor breaking changes which probably won't affect you, unless you're using some very advanced features.</p>
<h4 id="v1700">v17.00</h4>
<ol>
<li><code>ToSic.Eav.App.AppData</code> is renamed to <code>ToSic.Eav.Apps.DataSources.AppDataWithCrud</code></li>
<li>In Typed mode, the <code>App.Data</code> now has a different interface <code>ToSic.Sxc.Apps.IAppDataTyped</code></li>
<li><code>AppState</code> changes...</li>
<li><code>App</code> object had a hidden <code>AppState</code> property which was never documented and is now removed.<br>
If you were using it, then probably to access <code>GetContentType(string)</code>. You can find a replacement on <code>App.Data.GetContentType(...)</code>.</li>

<p>V16.00 doesn't have breaking changes; 16.02 has some very minor breaking changes</p>

<h4 id="api-changes-which-affect-you-if-you-had-installed-v1601-with-the-latest-blog-or-mobius">API Changes which affect you if you had installed v16.01 with the latest Blog or Mobius</h4>
<p>In v16.01 we had introduced a new Typed API, which turned out to be not good-enough.</p>
<p>This meant we had to rollback some of the changes we had introduced there,</p>
<h4 id="api-changes-which-should-really-not-affect-you">API Changes which should really not affect you</h4>
<ol>
<li>Various APIs which used to return an <code>IHybridHtmlString</code> now return an <code>IRawHtml</code><br>
This is to sync types with RazorBlade. It should have no effect on any code out there, as the result type is usually <code>dynamic</code></li>
<li>Renamed the type <code>ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicMetadata</code> to <code>ToSic.Sxc.Data.IMetadata</code><br>
This is technically a breaking change, but the type name should never have been used in any razor code, so it shouldn't affect anybody.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicField</code> to <code>ToSic.Sxc.Data.IField</code><br>
This is technically a breaking change, but the type name should never have been used in any razor code, so it shouldn't affect anybody.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Base classes were renamed because of confusing ...Pro suffix. RazorPro is now RazorTyped, ApiPro is ApiTyped and CodePro is CodeTyped #3147</li>
<li>Now by default, all access to a property like .String(&quot;SomeName&quot;) will throw an error in required mode if the field doesn't exist #3138</li>
<li>The .Parents(...) was enhanced to require named parameters (see blog post) #3139</li>

<p>In summary we've made a lot of internal breaking changes.
But for all normal users it will have no effect at all.</p>
</div>
<p>We believe it will only affect you in these scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have a <strong>custom DataSource</strong>, you will need to make some minor changes and recompile them</li>
<li>If you used special, non-public Logging APIs you would need to update your work</li>
<li>If you used any undocumented APIs, you will need to check if everything still works</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="api-changes-that-may-affect-you">API Changes that may affect you</h4>

</ol>
<h4 id="api-changes-which-should-really-not-affect-you">API Changes which should really not affect you</h4>
<p>These are internal APIs which we changed to make everything more immutable.
They should never have been in use outside of the internal code.</p>
<ol>
<li>Changed <code>IValue.Languages</code> from <code>IList</code> to <code>IEnumerable</code> and made it immutable</li>
<li>Change <code>IEntity.Attributes</code> from <code>Dictionary&lt;string, IAttribute&gt;</code> to <code>IImmutableDictionary&lt;string, IAttribute&gt;</code> as a step to later make it immutable</li>
<li>Removed some old, probably never used APIs on <code>IAttribute&lt;T&gt;</code> such as
<ul>
<li><code>IAttribute&lt;T&gt;[int[] languageIDs]</code></li>
<li><code>IAttribute&lt;T&gt;[string]</code></li>
<li><code>IAttribute&lt;T&gt;[string[]]</code></li>
<li><code>IAttribute[string[] languageKeys]</code> - was always marked as private</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>These were internal APIs which were not publicly documented, but may have been used by some developers.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>IEntity.GetDraft()</code> was removed to ensure the entity is immutable</li>
<li><code>IEntity.GetPublished()</code> was removed to ensure the entity is immutable</li>

They were only removed on <code>IEntity</code>.</p>
<h4 id="renamed-datasources">Renamed DataSources</h4>
<p>These data sources had uncommon names, and were renamed to be more consistent.
We believe that they were only used in VisualQuery and not in code, so it should not affect you.</p>

<p>We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API.
We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>V12 did a lot of internal rework to get it to run on Oqtane. Almost none of the changes will affect you.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-change-version-1210">Breaking Change Version 12.10</h3>
<ol>
<li>Jquery is completely removed. This shouldn't affect your code, since all old code usually runs in DNN where jQuery is included by default.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-change-version-1205">Breaking Change Version 12.05</h3>
<p>V12 adds new properties to Razor and WebAPI which could result in some surprises: <code>Path</code>, <code>Convert</code>, <code>Settings</code>, <code>Resources</code> and <code>DevTools</code>.
Especially the new <code>Path</code> and <code>Convert</code> could clash with existing code which had <code>@using System</code> or <code>@using System.IO</code> so the code would just read <code>Path.GetFileName(...)</code> or something.
Because of this, we only give the latest classes <code>Custom.Dnn.Razor12</code>, <code>Custom.Dnn.Code12</code>, <code>Custom.Hybrid.Razor12</code>, <code>Custom.Hybrid.Api12</code> etc. these properties.</p>
<p>This means that previous base classes do not have these by design, and we encourage you to move to these latest base classes.</p>

<p>Important: 2sxc 12.00 - 12.04 also had some of these properties on <code>ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent</code> as well as <code>ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.ApiController</code>.
So if you were eager to use these properties but didn't change the base class, you were able to use it.
To protect thousands of upgrade-scenarios we had to take them away from the old base classes. Sorry!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Possible Breaking Changes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>We believe nothing broke, but it could be that some commands on <code>EntitiesToDictionary</code> or <code>DataToDictionary</code> were accidentally changed. Pls report so we can fix that.</li>
<li>The <code>Link.To(...)</code> now returns safe URLs. This should not be an issue, but in rare cases post-processing of the string returned may expect spaces or something, which are now <code>%20</code></li>
<li>We disabled old obsolete APIs on the new Razor12, Api12 and Code12 base classes. In case you were using this (not likely) you'll get an error telling you about this.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-change-version-1204">Breaking Change Version 12.04</h3>
<ol>
<li>DynamicEntity now has a property Count because it's a list as well, this could cause issues if a content-type has a property <code>Count</code></li>
<li>DynamicEntity is now always a list. Because of this we removed the <code>DynamicEntityWithList</code> object. We believe the type is never referenced in user code, but if it is, this would be a breaking change.</li>
<li>Many parts that prepare Entities returned a <code>Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</code> and now return an <code>IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</code>.<br>
We believe this shouldn't hurt much, since the result would usually be in a <code>var</code> or returend directly to the API for streaming, but in case someone had used explicitly typed code, this will require a minor change</li>
</ol>

<p>We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API.
We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>There were small breaking changes in 11.00 to 11.11 but they were internal so shouldn't affect normal developers.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-version-1107---drop-the-old-edit-ui">Breaking Changes Version 11.07 - Drop the old edit UI</h3>
<ol>
<li>In 11.07 the old edit UI was removed, so customizations for that UI would not be in effect any more.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-version-1110---mainly-dependency-injection">Breaking Changes Version 11.10 - Mainly Dependency Injection</h3>
<ol>
<li>In v11.10 we used much more dependency injection than ever before and stopped using static values which were still in the API in many places. Because of this, certain helper objects to create entities or lookup values were changed and their constructors were changed. We invested a lot of time to try to ensure that old APIs still work, but in case you're hit by one of these, make sure you check the DI and switch to resolving the objects using DI.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-version-1111---language-detection">Breaking Changes Version 11.11 - Language Detection</h3>
<ol>
<li>Previously the language detection used the Thread culture. Turns out this wasn't reliable because Dnn does some funny stuff (probably historical) which means that API-calls ended up using the language stored in some cookie instead of the one specified by the URL. We changed this, which should be more reliable. But if you were relying on this strange effect, then it may be a breaking change.</li>
<li>Internally our tokens were also using the thread culture. When we changed this, we also had to change how tokens pick up the language. In rare cases this may affect you.</li>
<li>We changed all tokens to always resolve boolean values to <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> (previously they would have been changed to the current language, like <code>wahr</code> for german). We believe this change is only an improvement, and should ensure that internal resolves in Queries etc. result in reliable output.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-version-1111---datasources-datasourceconfiguration">Breaking Changes Version 11.11 - DataSources: DataSourceConfiguration</h3>
<p>Note that we also improved the <code>DataSourceConfiguration</code> to an interface <code>IDataSourceConfiguration</code> and documented this.
As a side effect the API stays the same, but you will have to recompile your data sources for them to work again - sorry.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-version-111103---ientity-values">Breaking Changes Version 11.11.03 - IEntity Values</h3>
<ol>
<li><code>IEntity</code> had a command called <code>Value(fieldName)</code> which was probably never used. The idea used to be that it does language lookup internally, but we refactored this out since it could never be fully reliable because the full language list wasn't known to the <code>IEntity</code>. So we re-purposed the method (assuming it's not used) to just lookup the first occurance of the value. This way it`s useful for configurations and similar which are not multi-language.</li>
<li><code>IEntity</code> also had a <code>Value(fieldname, lookup)</code> method. We are deprecating it, and making the lookup not happen from now on. We believe it was never used.</li>
<li><code>IEntity</code> had a command called <code>PrimaryValue(fieldName)</code> which was probably never ever used, so we're deprecating it. Use <code>Value(fieldName)</code> instead.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-version-111103---other">Breaking Changes Version 11.11.03 - Other</h3>
<ol>
<li>UI Toolbar dropped the button and command for <code>item-history</code>, as the history is now part of the edit dialog</li>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 10 has a lot of small breaking changes because
we restructured the internal API so it's consistent when we publish it.
All these things shouldn't affect you, because they were internal APIs,
but in case it does - here's what we did.</p>

<li>Split SOC of the <code>AppRoot</code> DataSource so that caching, Root-Metadata and ListCache is fully separate</li>
<li>Since the Logging system now auto-picks up the code lines and names of the methods, we simplified the commands and dropped some parameters.</li>
<li>Moved quite a bit of the DataSource objects into sub-objects, again for SOC.</li>
