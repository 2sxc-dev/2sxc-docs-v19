The dynamic data system used in 2sxc. It's primary purpose is to ensure that you can easily
use dynamic objects to write templates, tokens and more. we have two different topics covered:

1. Dynamic Entities to simplify code using [](xref:ToSic.Eav.Data.IEntity) objects - [](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicEntity) and [](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.DynamicEntity)
1. Dynamic Jackets to simplify code using JSON - `ToSic.Sxc.Data.DynamicJacket`s and `ToSic.Sxc.Data.DynamicJacketList`s
