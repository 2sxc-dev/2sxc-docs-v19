The Engines are the part of 2sxc that create output based on data. 

It's basically the part that takes a full configuration, consisting of...

1. What App
1. What View
1. What Template
1. What Data - could be from a query or from the instance

...and then generates an HTML using Razor or Tokens or whatever engine may come in future.
