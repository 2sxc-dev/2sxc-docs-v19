The **ToSic.Eav.Formats** Namespace contain DTO-style objects which are meant for transferring or import/export of data. 

Most of the formats are currently not publicly documented, as they can still change a bit. 

Note that the formats themselves are more like DTO objects, so they can be serialized to JSON, XML or other future data formats.
