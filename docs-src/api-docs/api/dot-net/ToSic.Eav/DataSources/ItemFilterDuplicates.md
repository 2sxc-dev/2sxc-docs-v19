The **ItemFilterDuplicates** [DataSource](xref:NetCode.DataSources.DataSource) is part of the [Standard EAV Data Sources](xref:Basics.Query.DataSources.Index). It will provide two streams, one with all the items (but without the duplicates) and one with all the duplicates, in case you need these. 

## How to use with the VisualQuery
When using the  [VisualQuery](xref:Basics.Query.VisualQuery.Index)  you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like:

<img src="./assets/item-filter-duplicates-basic.png" width="100%" class="full-width">

The above example shows two filters finding items and delivering them on the same stream. 

Because 1 item would have been delivered 2x (2sic is in Switzerland), the default-stream now only contains each item once, and the duplicates can also be retrieved from the _Duplicates_ stream if needed.

## Example Using StreamMerge
A common scenario will also combine this using the [StreamMerge](xref:ToSic.Eav.DataSources.StreamMerge). It's demonstrated there. 



## No Settings
The ItemFilterDuplicates DataSource has no settings to configure.

Note that it will automatically merge the streams in A-Z order of the In-Stream names.
