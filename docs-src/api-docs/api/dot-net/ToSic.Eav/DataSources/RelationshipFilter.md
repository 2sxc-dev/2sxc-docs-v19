The **RelationshipFilter** [DataSource](xref:NetCode.DataSources.DataSource) is part of the [Standard EAV Data Sources](xref:Basics.Query.DataSources.Index). It will return only the items which have a relationship to another item - like books having an author, or blog-posts with the tag _grunt_. 

## How to use with the VisualQuery
When using the  [VisualQuery](xref:Basics.Query.VisualQuery.Index)  you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like:

## Using Url Parameters
You can of course also use URL parameters for both the value as well as the field:

## Using the Fallback
In case none of the items match the reqiurement, then either no items are returned, or those in the fallback stream:

You can find more fallback examples like chaining them in the [ValueFilter DataSource](xref:ToSic.Eav.DataSources.ValueFilter)

## Separators for Multiple Criterias (2sxc 9.9+)
Until 2sxc 9.8 you could only check for 1 related item, so you could only say "give me all items which have this one author". In 2sxc 9.9 we are now able to specify multiple authors, allowing queries like "give me all items which have all these authors" or "give me all items which have any of these authors". 

This works using the separation-character, which is usually a comma `,` but could be something different (in case your items have commas in the texts you're comparing). If you don't specify a separator, none will be used and the whole `Filter` criteria is treated as one value. Here's where you set it:

## All Operators (2sxc 9.9+)
Untill 2sxc 9.8, you could not specify an operator, and `contains` was the assumed operator. In 9.9 we added a lot more. To explain what each does, assume that our main stream contains items of `BlogPost` and we only want to keep the posts having certain `Tags`.

Here's the list, each is explained more below:

1. `contains` - will return all items (BlogPosts), having **all** the children (tags) specified
1. `containsany` - will return all items (BlogPosts) having **any** of the children (tags) specified
1. `not-contains` will return all items (BlogPosts) **not-having-all** of the children (tags). So it will also return those items, having some of the children.
1. `not-containsany` will return all items (BlogPosts) having **none** of the children (tags) specified.
1. `any` will return all items (BlogPosts) having **any children at all** (tags). So the filter is ignored. This is the same as count=0.
1. `not-any` will return all items (BlogPosts) having **no children** (tags).
1. `first` will return all items (BlogPosts) where the **first child** (tag) is one of the filter-options. This is for scenarios where you say the first tag is a primary-category or similar.
1. `not-first` will return  all items (BlogPosts) where the first children (tags) is not one of the filter values.
1. `count` will return all items (BlogPosts) having a **specific amount** of children (tags)
1. `not-count` will return all items (BlogPosts) **not having a specific amount** of children (tags)


## Filtering On Fields other than Title and ID (9.9+)
In 2sxc 9.9 we added the ability to specify which field you want to compare (before it was always Id or Title). Here's an example:

## Filtering by Relationship-Count (9.9+)
In 2sxc 9.9 we added the ability to filter by amount of relationships - so you could say "give me all blog-posts with exactly 2 tags":

<img src="./assets/relationship-filter-count.png" width="100%" class="full-width">

Note: you can also reverse this, so instead of `count` you can use `not-count` to get all the items that don't match this requirement. 

## Filtering by Has-Any (9.9+)
In 2sxc 9.9 we added the ability to filter by 

## Limitations of the RelationshipFilter
Note that as of now (2sxc 9.9) the RelationshipFilter:

1. can only seek child-items

1. Introduced in EAV 4.x, 2sxc ?
1. Added AttributeOnRelationship (to compare other fields that title/id) in 2sxc 9.9
1. Added separator to enable multi-filter in 2sxc 9.9
1. Added various operators like `count`, `first`, `containsany`, `any`, `not-*` in 2sxc 9.9
