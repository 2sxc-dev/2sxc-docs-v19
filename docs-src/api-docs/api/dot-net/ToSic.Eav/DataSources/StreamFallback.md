The **StreamFallback** [DataSource](xref:NetCode.DataSources.DataSource) is part of the [Standard EAV Data Sources](xref:Basics.Query.DataSources.Index). It will pass on the first stream which has results. The order of evaluation is based on the names of the streams as they enter the StreamFallback. 

## How to use with the VisualQuery
When using the  [VisualQuery](xref:Basics.Query.VisualQuery.Index)  you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like:

The above example shows a query from the [blog app](https://2sxc.org/en/apps/app/dnn-blog-app-for-dnn-dotnetnuke):

1. a stream-fallback with 4 in-streams
2. the first stream which would filter by tag, if the URL had a tag in it - as the test-data has no tag, this stream delivers no results
2. the second stream filters by author - as the url would have an author (specified in the test-values), it does return items

The StreamFallback therefor passes on the items provided by the author-filter. Note that while using the VisualQuery, all other streams are also processed to show what's happening. At runtime it will stop processing other streams once it's found a first match.
