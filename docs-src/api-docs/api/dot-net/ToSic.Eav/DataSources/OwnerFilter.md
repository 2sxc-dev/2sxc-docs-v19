The **OwnerFilter** [DataSource](xref:NetCode.DataSources.DataSource) is part of the [Standard EAV Data Sources](xref:Basics.Query.DataSources.Index). It will only let items pass through, which a specific user (often the current one) has created initially. 

You will typically use the **OwnerFilter** in scenarios where users create their own data, and should only see/edit items which they own (usually in combination with security settings, which only allow the owner to modify their own items).

## How to use with the VisualQuery
When using the  [VisualQuery](xref:Basics.Query.VisualQuery.Index)  you can just drag it into your query. You must then edit the settings once - and usually you will use the recommended prefilled-form. But you can also do something different. This is what it usually looks like:

The above example shows:

1. a content-type filter limiting the items to type _Company_
2. an owner-filter which receives 5 items, but only lets 3 pass, because the _Test Settings_ have a demo-value of the user who only created 3 of the 5 items.
