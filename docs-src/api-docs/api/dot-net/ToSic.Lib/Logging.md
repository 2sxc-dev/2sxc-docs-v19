uid: ToSic.Lib.Logging

The EAV system has a powerful internal logging system. It's the backbone to Insights.

This is where it resides - usually you don't want to know about it ;).

If you do, here a short conceptual background:

* Any object can have a property - usually called `Log` which is an [](xref:ToSic.Lib.Logging.ILog) .  
 Using this the object can call the `Log.Add(...)` to add messages. Many other commands help in various scenarios.

* The real power comes from chaining these - because each logger can know what parent-logger it reports to.  
 This allows us to reproduce the chain of events in the original code, because you can track where  
 loggers were made, and how they relate.

* The really amazing bit is that the logger will also pick up the
 class names, code-file names and line of code where it was logged 😎.

* Most objects which use the Log, implement the [](xref:ToSic.Lib.Logging.IHasLog), often by inheriting  
 [](xref:ToSic.Lib.Logging).HasLog which automates things when initializing - like the chaining of the Loggers.
