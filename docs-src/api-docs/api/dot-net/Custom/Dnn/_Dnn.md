title: Custom.Dnn Namespace for Dnn ☢️
---

This contains all the base classes for your own solutions, which are targeted to Dnn ☢️.

> [!TIP]
> Code created with these base classes will _not_ work in Oqtane 🩸.
> Because of this, we recommend to use the [Hybrid](xref:Custom.Hybrid) namespace.
>
> Note that the Hybrid namespace is also compatible with Dnn ☢️,
> and the classes there have more features and are easier to use.
