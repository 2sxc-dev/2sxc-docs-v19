uid: Custom.Dnn.Razor12
summary: Base Class for Dynamic CSharp Razor in Dnn ☢️ only.
---

This is the Dnn specific base class. It's the very same as `Custom.Hybrid.Razor12` except for the additional `Dnn`.
If you inherit from this class, you'll automatically have all the properties from [DynamicCode](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.Index).

Because of this, the documentation here only shows `Dnn` - for all other properties go to [Custom.Hybrid.Razor12](xref:Custom.Hybrid.Razor12)

> [!TIP]
> If you don't need the `Dnn` object, we strongly suggest to move to the Hybrid implementation.
>
> The latest Hybrid base classes also have many new features and are easier to use.
> See [](xref:Custom.Hybrid) for more information.
