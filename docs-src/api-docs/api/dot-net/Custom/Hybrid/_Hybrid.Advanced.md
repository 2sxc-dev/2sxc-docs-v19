# Custom.Hybrid.Advanced Namespace

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an internal namespace.
>
> You should never inherit from this.
> It's only included in the docs so that the API can be made visible.
> You should always inherit from the `Custom.Hybrid` implementation,
> such as `Custom.Hybrid.Razor14` and _not_ `Custom.Hybrid.Advanced.Razor14<...>`.
>
> That implementation has the same objects/commands as documented here
