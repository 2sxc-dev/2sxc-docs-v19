# Formulas JavaScript V1 Specs 🥱 (obsolete)

V1 formulas were the first formulas introduced.
The documentation for them is preserved, as you'll still see them around.

## V1 Function Specs

1. All functions must be called `v1`, it must be lower case
   This is important because we cannot guess when the API will change
1. The first line in the code must start with the function name `v1`. You cannot put comments or empty lines before the `v1`
1. Your function _must_ have brackets afterwards and it can have 0, 1 or two params, so you can use one of the following
    * `v1() { ... }`
    * `v1(data) { ... }`
    * `v1(data, context) { ...}`
1. The parameter names are anything you want, but the order of what you get is always `data` and then `context`. You can also write
    * `v1(d, c) { ... }`


## The `data` and `context` Objects

👉🏼 See [data](xref:JsCode.EditForm.Formulas.Data)

👉🏼 See [context](xref:JsCode.EditForm.Formulas.Context)


## Return a Valid Value

Each field type or property may expect a different data type. Make sure you provide that.

> [!WARNING]
> If you return nothing, `undefined` or the wrong data type, the result will be ignored and the value/setting will not be changed.

Common Mistakes

* returning nothing with `return;` - this will be regarded as an error and be ignored.
* returning `undefined`.
* Returning a [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) instead of a real `true` or `false` for a boolean value
