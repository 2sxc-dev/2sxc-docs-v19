# Formulas JavaScript V2 Specs 🆕 v16

V2 formulas are a major enhancement to [v1](xref:JsCode.EditForm.Formulas.V1) formulas.
Improvements include:

1. **Intellisense** while typing the formula using VS Code

1. **Promise** support

1. Ability to **stop** the formula from running

1. Ability to **set other fields** from a formula

1. Ability to add **Comments** before the formula

1. Ability to get **App Settings** in your formula

1. Ability to return **Validation** on a field

## V2 Function Specs

```js
// new formula syntax - see https://go.2sxc.org/formulas
v2((data, context) => {
  return data.value;
});
```

1. All functions must be called `v2`, it must be lower case  
   This is important because when APIs change, we will use v3, etc.

1. The first line in the code must start with the function name `v2`.  
    You _can_ put comments or empty lines before the `v2`, but they must always use `//` and not `/* */`

1. The `v2(...)` function takes 1 parameter, namely the function to execute. This is different from v1.

1. The reason we need an inner function is so that VS Code can provide intellisense while you type.

1. Your function _must_ look like one of these
    * `v2(() => { ... });`
    * `v2((data) => { ... });`
    * `v2((data, context) => { ... });`

1. The parameter names are anything you want, but the order of what you get is always `data` and then `context`. You can also write
    * `v2((d, c) => { ... });`


## V2 `data` and `context` Objects

👉🏼 See [data](xref:JsCode.EditForm.Formulas.Data)

👉🏼 See [context](xref:JsCode.EditForm.Formulas.Context)


## V2 Returned Values

👉🏼 See [Return Values](xref:JsCode.EditForm.Formulas.V2Return)



## Tips and Tricks

1. You can always add a `console.log(data, context);` or similar in your code to see in real time what's being processed.
1. You can also add a line `debugger;` and the browser will stop at this line so you can inspect the variables and watch your code.
1. For now, we strongly recommend to use Formulas as [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), but with experience the recommendation may change.
