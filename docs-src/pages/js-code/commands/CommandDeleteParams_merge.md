### delete Command

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .edit-custom { visibility: visible; } </style>

This button let's a user really delete a content item (since 2sxc 8.9).

### How to use

Here's a basic example showing a 2sxc-toolbar with a custom code:

```razor
@Edit.Toolbar(toolbar: new { 
    action = "delete", 
    entityId = tag.EntityId, 
    entityGuid = tag.EntityGuid, 
    entityTitle = tag.EntityTitle })

```
The previous example just renders a delete-button. Here's an example creating an entire toolbar, incl. the delete-button.

```razor
@Edit.Toolbar(Content, toolbar: new { 
    entityId = Content.EntityId, 
    entityGuid = Content.EntityGuid, 
    entityTitle = Content.EntityTitle })
```
Note that for the delete-button to appear, the following conditions must be met:

1. It is _not_ an module-assigned item (also knows as content-mode), because in this case the item is in use, and it cannot be quick-deleted anyhow
2. It has an entityId - used to show to the user to help him be sure he's deleting the right item
3. It has an entityTitle - also shown to the user to be sure he's deleting the right thing
3. It has an entityGuid - used as the ID when deleting the data as an extra level of security. 


### Notes and Clarifications

requires id, title and guid. otherwise the button won't appear

## History
