# npm Types Help Write Error-Free Code

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .browser-all { visibility: visible; } </style>

The 2sxc core JavaScript is developed with TypeScript.

To help you write type-safe code, we've published the types on [@2sic.com/sxc-typings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@2sic.com/2sxc-typings).

So just get them from there and use them in your code.
