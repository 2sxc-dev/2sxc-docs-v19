# How To Customize the Toolbars

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .edit-custom { visibility: visible; } </style>

A lot in 2sxc is fully automatic. But sometimes you want to customize how the content editor can work.

> [!NOTE]
> 2sxc 10.27 introduces a much simpler system, which is what is shown here.
> Previously everything was possible, but quite complicated.
> So if you find examples out there which look very different - they work as well, but here's the simple system.

## Live Examples

The [Dnn Tutorials have a live demo of toolbar customization](xref:Tut.Toolbar). Head over there while reading these docs to see all this in action.

## Overview - What You can Customize

You can customize just about everything:

1. hover-behavior - you may want hover, maybe not, and maybe to the right | left
1. colors using color names, hex-codes or CSS classes of the entire toolbar or just of individual buttons
1. you can just enhance/change the default toolbar or create a custom one with just your buttons
1. you can change the button groups - add, remove etc.
1. you can add/remove buttons as you need
1. you can create buttons with custom icons
1. you can even call custom code from your custom buttons

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This will show you how to do things in Razor, but the same principles apply to plain HTML-Toolbars.
> We assume that 99% of all toolbars will be initiated from razor, so that's what we'll be showing here.

## Getting Started with Custom Toolbars

Usually your code will look a bit like this:

```cshtml-razor
<div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content)>
  ...
</div>
```

This will create a standard hover-toolbar with some buttons and the _more_ ellipsis button. Note that the exact combination of buttons is auto-detected. So you may just have an _edit_ but you may also have an _add_ etc. depending on the template and the data it receives. It looks approx. like this:

<img src="./assets/step-1-default-toolbar.png" width="100%" class="full-width">

### Add our First Button

Let's add an extra _new_ button to create an item of the content-type _Category_.

> [!NOTE]
> This code will make the button appear, but on click you may see an error, because you probably don't have a ContentType _Category_ in your app.

```razor
<div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: "+new?contentType=Category")>
  ...
</div>
```

You should now have an extra + button like this:

<img src="./assets/step-1-with-plus-button.png" width="100%" class="full-width">



Let's emphasize it, because for whatever reason it's a super important button. We'll also drop the leading `+` since it's optional and defaulted to:

```razor
<div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: "new&color=red?contentType=Category")>
  ...
</div>
```

You should now have a _red_ + button like this:

<img src="./assets/step-1-with-plus-button-red.png" width="100%" class="full-width">

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The term `new` in this example means we want a button of _type_ `new` which will open the dialog to create new entities.  
> We could also write `app&color=red` which would add a button to manage the app.
> So `new` â‰  'new button' but 'button to add a new entity'. The full list of button names can be found in the [CMS Commands list](xref:JsCode.Commands.Index).

### Adding more Buttons

Now we want to add another button - maybe to add a _Tag_. The `toolbar` attribute on the [Edit.TagToolbar](xref:NetCode.Razor.Edit.Toolbar) can take various kinds of objects, but for the new simple API it only accepts `string` objects or `string[]` arrays. So to make multiple changes to the toolbar, we'll have to give it a `string[]` array like this (note that we can use line-breaks, to make the code easier to read):

```razor
<div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { 
  "new&color=red?contentType=Category", 
  "new&color=teal?contentType=Tag" 
})>
  ...
</div>
```

You should now see this:

<img src="./assets/step-1-with-plus-button-red-and-teal.png" width="100%" class="full-width">

> [!TIP]
> When creating new items you can also add prefill default values. This is great for News-Apps where you want to prefill the date or for list of something where you want to prefill the category. Check out the [specs](xref:Basics.Browser.EditUx.Toolbars.Customize).

### Removing Buttons with `-`

Now maybe you don't like to allow your editors to change the view - so let's do the same but remove the view-switch button as well using the remove `-` prefix:

```razor
<div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { 
  "-layout",
  "new&color=red?contentType=Category", 
  "new&color=teal?contentType=Tag" 
})>
  ...
</div>
```

<img src="./assets/step-1-without-view.png" width="100%" class="full-width">

So you can add / remove any button you want. You can find a [full list of button names (command names)](xref:JsCode.Commands.Index).

### Modifying Existing Buttons with `%`

But what if we want to modify an existing button? Let's change the icon and both colors of the `layout` (view) button using the modify `%` prefix:

```razor
<div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { 
  "%layout&icon=icon-sxc-replace&color=white,maroon",
  "new&color=red?contentType=Category", 
  "new&color=teal?contentType=Tag" 
})>
  ...
</div>
```

<img src="./assets/step-1-modified-view.png" width="100%" class="full-width">

As you can see, we just used `%` to modify a button, set the `icon` and 2 colors.

### Show Only Our Buttons

But maybe we would prefer to have a toolbar with only the two _add_ buttons, and nothing else. By default, the toolbar uses a template called `default` which contains all these buttons. But you can always start with an `empty` template. You'll find the full list of templates [here](xref:Basics.Browser.EditUx.Toolbars.Customize).

```razor
<div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { 
  "toolbar=empty",
  "new&color=red?contentType=Category", 
  "new&color=teal?contentType=Tag" 
})>
  ...
</div>
```

<img src="./assets/step-1-empty-and-2-plus-buttons.png" width="100%" class="full-width">

> [!TIP]
> As you can see, the principle is to use a toolbar template and make modifications to it.

### Showing the Delete Button

> [!WARNING]
> A special case in modifying buttons is also to force-show the `delete` button which is hidden by default.
> The reason it's hidden is because in most content-editing scenarios the editor should be able to remove content, but not delete it - in case it's re-used elsewhere.

But let's say you created a **News App** and want to allow the editor to also delete the news-items. Here's how:

```razor
<div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: "%delete&show=true")>
  ...
</div>
```

The `delete` button is in the third group of buttons, so you'll have to hit the ellipsis a few times to see it. You'll then see:

<img src="./assets/step-1-show-delete.png" width="100%" class="full-width">




## Adding Custom Groups

Let's assume you understand the principle of adding, removing and changing buttons. Let's add a custom button group with only the buttons you want - followed by the normal ellipsis-button with the standard functionality:

```razor
<div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { 
    "group=add-buttons",
    "new&color=red&group=add-buttons?contentType=Category", 
    "new&color=teal&group=add-buttons?contentType=Tag" 
})>
  ...
</div>
```

You'll get this result, and hitting the ellipsis will show you the default buttons as you can see in the second image:

<img src="./assets/step-2-custom-group.png" width="100%" class="full-width">

<img src="./assets/step-2-custom-group2.png" width="100%" class="full-width">

> [!NOTE]
> We had to give our new group a name - in this case `add-buttons` and told the new buttons that they should go inside that group.

> [!TIP]
> A new group can also go after the `default` group of buttons. If you add a `&pos=1` or another number the group will be placed later on in the sequence.
> You can also use `&pos=-0` or `&pos=-1` or similar to place it counting from the end of the list.

> [!WARNING]
> When using position like `pos=#` you may have unexpected results, because the button is added to the list _before_ some buttons decide to hide themselves.
> So you may think you're adding it to `pos=1` but if the edit button (which would be at position 0) shouldn't be shown, your button will still appear to be the first one.

There is also a hidden group called `edit-advanced` - you can find the [list of groups](xref:Basics.Browser.EditUx.Toolbars.ButtonGroups) here. As of now, it only contains the `delete` button which is hidden by default.


## Attaching Custom JavaScript Code to a Button

Now you may want to call your own code when you create a button. This is very advanced stuff, but here's how:

```razor
<div class="demobox" @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, 
  toolbar: "custom&title=Message?call=myMessage&id=17")
>
    This demonstrates a custom button with the call-name in the parameters. 
</div>
<script>
    function myMessage(context, event) {
        console.log(context, event);
        alert('hello from my Message - got this id:' + context.button.command.params.id);
    }
</script>
```

You'll then see this toolbar, and on click this message:

<img src="./assets/pro-1-custom-js-call.png" width="100%" class="full-width">

<img src="./assets/pro-1-custom-js-alert.png" width="100%" class="full-width">

You'll notice that we have a `?call=functionName` and also an `id=17` just to show how additional information is passed around. Your function also gets an `event` from the browser, so you can check the `event.target` and other things to see what was actually clicked.

> [!WARNING]
> This is very advanced stuff, you may run into difficulties to get this to fly ðŸ˜‰.


## Debugging Custom Toolbars

In most cases if your problems will be caused by invalid syntax. It's easy to forget a closing quote `"` or a comma `,` to separate values. So always check that first.

If you really want to do deep debugging, you should use the `$2sxc.insights()` command in the console to see what whas processed and how. If you add `?debug=true` to the url of the page, it will also log way more intermediate data for you to review.
