# In-Page Edit Toolbars and Buttons

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .edit-custom { visibility: visible; } </style>

When a user is logged on and has edit permissions, he should see buttons to edit his content or perform other actions. This is all done in HTML / JavaScript. By default, the server will render this in places defined by the template using placeholders like `@Edit.TagToolbar(Content)` and similar.

Note that usually this HTML is generated by a server-side template, and will usually be wrapped in a if-user-logged-in condition.

So if you want to do things differently, here's how - just remember that this is an advanced use case so it's a bit harder than what you're used to with 2sxc :).
