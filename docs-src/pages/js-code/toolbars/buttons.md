# Toolbar Button Definitions

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .edit-custom { visibility: visible; } </style>

When you create custom buttons in a floating toolbar you can customize everything including the icon and more. This is explained here.

Buttons are of html, basically a `<a click="...">[some-icon]</a>`. When the button is created, it must already know what it's for, which is why the command must be prepared when the button is created. 

## How to use
A short example of a slightly customized button definition:

```html
var btns = [{
    command: { 
        action: "new",
        contentType: "Category"
    },
    title: "create Category"
}, {
    command: { 
        action: "new",
        contentType: "Author"
    },
    title: "create Author"
}];
```
This simple example shows two `new` buttons creating different kinds of things, and we customized the label so the mouse-over would tell the editor which button is which. 

Let's get a bit more sophisticated 

```javascript
var btn = {
    command: { 
        // some command here
    },
    icon: "icon-sxc-code", 
    title: "this is my special button", 
    classes: "redButton",
};
```
The above example shows all than can currently be configured one a button. 

And here's a much more complex example. This is the **full** object-structure which the button generator `getButton(...)` understands:

```javascript
// full version
var btn = {
    title: "some title - ideally from translation table",
    icon: "some icon like icon-sxc-bomb",
    command: {
        action: "some action name like new",
        moreParamsAsNeeded: "..."
    },
    showCondition: someValueOr function(itemSettings) {
        return true;
    },
    classes: "btn-xyz my-class",
    dynamicClasses: function(itemSettings) {
        if( (new Date()).getDay() === 1 )
            return "color-monday";
    }
};

// typically more compact edition (will be expanded at runtime)
var btn2 = {
    title: "my button!",
    icon: "icon-sxc-list",
    action: "layout"
};

// or the totally compact edition
var btn3 = "layout";
```


## Some functioning code
You may wonder how to actually use this. Here's an JSON example:

```html
<p class="sc-element">
    mouse over this to see inline-json version
    <ul class="sc-menu" data-toolbar='[{
            "command": { 
                "action": "new",
                "contentType": "Category"
            },
            "title": "create Category"
        }, {
            "command": { 
                "action": "new",
                "contentType": "Author"
            },
            "title": "create Author"
    }]'></ul>
</p>
```

Here's a more sophisticated (but also more reusable) example:

```html
<p class="sc-element">
    mouse over this to see the js toolbar generated by the buttons-list
    <toolbars2Buttons></toolbars2Buttons>
</p>
<script>
    var toolbars2Buttons =  [{
            command: { 
                action: "new",
                contentType: "Category"
            },
            title: "create Category"
        }, {
            command: { 
                action: "new",
                contentType: "Author"
            },
            title: "create Author"
    }];
    
    // note that we cannot create the toolbars before the page-onready. Because of this
    // our code which creates the toolbar must be delayed, like in a $(our-code);
    $(function(){
        if(typeof $2sxc != "undefined")   // continue if $2sxc exists; it may be missing in non-edit modes
            $("toolbars2Buttons").each(function(index, element){
                var controller = $2sxc(element);
                if(!controller.isEditMode())    // check if this specific module currently allows editing
                    return;
                    
                var toolbar = controller.manage.getToolbar(toolbars2Buttons);
                $(element).replaceWith(toolbar);
            });
    });
</script>
```

## How it works
Buttons are used in toolbars all the time, and before they are rendered, the must be fully configured/expanded, as shown in the larger example. Internally the button is built with whatever is given, and anything not defined yet is automatically filled with the defaults. The defaults are taken from the [commands definitions][definitions]. 

Here's how the _get defaults_ works: 

1. if all that is knows about a button is the name like `var btn = "new"`, then it gets `all` the configuration from the defaults
1. if some properties are known, like `var btn = { command: {action: "new"}, icon: "myicon" }`, then only the missing properties are taken from the defaults.

Note that retrieving defaults requires the button to know which command it's for, so the name of the command is essential. 

## The Button Properties 

1. object `command` the internal command which will be called, should contain both the name and the parameters like `{ action: "new", contentType: "BlogPost"}` see also [commands](xref:JsCode.Commands.Index)
1. string `icon` a css class giving the button the icon. It can be one of the icons 2sxc provides, or it can be your own - just be sure to include a CSS & font which resolves the icon
1. string `title` a text which is shown on mouse-over. Note that 2sxc will try to run it through the translator, so you can also use placeholders like `Toolbar.Metadata`
1. string `classes` comma separated list of class-names like `makeRed,glowHover`
1. function `dynamicClasses(settings)` can be used to dynamically build classes depending on the situation
1. bool/function ~~`showCondition`~~ (_API still experimental_) - used to dynamically choose if this button should be shown or not
1. bool ~~`disabled`~~ (_API still experimental_) would disable the click on a button
1. bool `partOfPage` (_API still experimental_, _new in 2sxc 9.5_) determines if resulting changes should effect the [Evoq/Dnn Page Publishing](xref:Basics.Cms.PagePublishing.Index) - note that it only effects the page-lifecyle, if the resulting dialogs and APIs respect this setting

## Some more Notes
Because the button is often passed around as plain text/html, it can't rely on hidden variables to keep track of anything. This is why the `onclick` is so verbose, like `onclick="$2sxc(4030).manage.run({"action": "edit", "entityId": 42 })`. This is to ensure it always survives the text-round-trip.
