### `sxc.query` Services of the Sxc Instance

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .interact-2sxc { visibility: visible; } </style>

A common need in JS is to read/write data from/to the backend. 

2sxc 13 introduce new JS APIs for this. 

* `data(...)` gets a data service to read/write data ðŸ‘‰ [docs](xref:Api.Js.SxcJs.SxcData)
* `query(...)` gets a query service to call server-side queries (this document)

_Note: You can do all what these services do using [webApi.fetchJson(...)](xref:JsCode.2sxcApi.Sxc.WebApi.Fetch), but this is more convenient._

### Get a Query Service

1. Get the [Sxc Instance](xref:JsCode.2sxcApi.Sxc.Index) of the current module
1. Call `.query(queryName)` to get the service

Example:

```js
const modId = @CmsContext.Module.Id;
const sxc = $2sxc(modId);
const authorsSvc = sxc.query('BlogPosts');
authorsSvc.getAll().then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Query Service Factory Parameters

The `query(...)` factory just has one parameter: the `queryName`. 

The returned service will always perform actions for this query. 

### Query Service APIs

Query Services always return a [modern Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) containing data. 

A Query Service has the following commands:

* `getAll()` - no parameters, will return an object with all the streams, each containing an arrays of all the data in that stream
* `getAll(urlParams)` - same as above but with url-parameters as a string or object
* `getAll(urlParams, data)` - same as above but with post-data
* `getStream(streamName)` - Same as GetAll, just using a specific stream name to retrieve
* `getStream(streamName, urlParams)` - Same as `getStream`, just with additional url parameters
* `getStream(streamName, urlParams, data)` - Same as before, just with post-data
* `getStreams(streamNames)` - Same as GetAll, just using a specific stream name to retrieve - can have multiple stream names comma-separated
* `getStreams(streamNames, urlParams)` - Same as above, just with additional url parameters
* `getStreams(streamNames, urlParams, data)` - Same as above, just with post-data

### Returned Data

`getAll` and `getStreams` return multiple streams. 
The resulting object is based on this structure:

```json
{
  "Default": [
    { ... },
    { ... }
  ],
  "NextStreamName": [
    { ... },
    { ... }
  ]
}
```

`getStream` only retrieves one stream, so the it's clear that we don't need to pick by stream. 
The resulting object is based on this structure. 

```json
[
  { ... },
  { ... }
]
```
