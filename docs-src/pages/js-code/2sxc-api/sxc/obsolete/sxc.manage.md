# Manage Everything With the `manage` Instance

> [!WARNING]
> This is obsolete code and will stop working soon. 
> Please use newer APIs instead like `.cms.run(...)`

The `manage` object helps you manage content, allowing you to `run(...)` [commands](xref:JsCode.Commands.Index) or to get [buttons or toolbars](xref:JsCode.Toolbars.Index). 

## How to use
Each content-block (usually a Dnn-Module) has it's own 2sxc-instance, which also gives you a prepared manage-object to work with. Here's an example

```html
<a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run("layout")'>layout</a>
```

this click-event will look up the 2sxc-instance using `$2sxc(this)`, then use the manage-object provided by this to then run the **layout** command. The **layout** command opens the change-template dialog. 

Here's an example to generate a toolbar from code:

```html
<p class="sc-element">
    mouse over this to see the js toolbar generated by the groups of buttons
    <toolbarsGroups></toolbarsGroups>
</p>

<script>
    var toolbarsGroups = {
        groups: [ 
            { buttons: "layout,more"}, 
            { buttons: "app,zone,more" } 
        ]
    };
        
    $(function(){
        $("toolbarsGroups").each(function(index, element){
            var sxc = $2sxc(element);
            var toolbar = sxc.manage.getToolbar(toolbarsGroups);
            $(element).replaceWith(toolbar);
        });
    });
</script>
```
The example above has a function which will look for all `<toolbarsGroups>` tags and replace them with the HTML provided by `manage.getToolbar(...)`.  

## How it works
Basically the manage-property _only exists_ when the user has edit permissions, as 2sxc will automatically include the necessary JS in the page. So if the user doesn't have edit-rights, the `.manage` property will be `undefined`. If it does exist, it can be used to do perform these kinds of actions. 

## Properties and Methods
We try to keep APIs very light, so all the internal properties/objects are not documented and should not be used. These properties and methods can be treated as stable:

* void `.run(...)` - used to run a [command](xref:JsCode.Commands.Index)
* string `.getButton(...)` - used to generate HTML for a single button (which when pressed, runs a command) - see [buttons and toolbars](xref:JsCode.Toolbars.Index)
* string `.getToolbar(...)` - used to generate HTML for a toolbar (with buttons, which run commands) - see [buttons and toolbars](xref:JsCode.Toolbars.Index)
