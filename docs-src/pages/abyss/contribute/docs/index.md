# Contribute to Documentation

First of all: Thank you üôèüèΩ for considering to contribute to the documentation üéâ. We really appreciate it.

These are the things you can do, in order of complexity.
You should really start with the first one, and only move on if you're comfortable with it.

1. Just get the docs and view locally
2. Improve existing content
3. Add new content, link around and add tables of Contents
4. Create/improve docs to the C# source-code
5. Create/improve docs to the JavaScript source-code
6. Create/improve the build process

## Level 1: Get the Docs and View Locally

1. Download the docs to your PC and figure out the VS-Code setup, so you can work locally and preview the result.  
    ‚û°Ô∏è [Setup & Preview Docs Locally using VS-Code](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Setup.Index)

1. Run the docs-build to see if everything works.  
    ‚û°Ô∏è [Build the Documentation](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Build.DocsOnly)

## Level 2: Improve Existing Content

Content is written using [Markdown](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Edit.Markdown.Index).
This is a common format used for Wikipedia, GitHub and many other places.

1. Enable the preview in VS-Code to see your changes live.  
    ‚û°Ô∏è [Enable Preview in VS-Code](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Edit.PreviewMarkdown)
1. Remember to re-run the docs-build to see if everything works.  
    ‚û°Ô∏è [Build the Documentation](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Build.DocsOnly)

Once you've grown comfortable with [Basic Markdown](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Edit.Markdown.Index), you can also learn about [Images, Lightboxes](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Edit.Images) and then move on to [Galleries](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Edit.Galleries), flowcharts and more.

## Level 3: Create New Pages and TOCs

After graduating from Level 2, you can start creating new content and linking it together.
This includes things like:

1. Create new markdown pages `*.md`
1. [Link to them](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Edit.Markdown.Index) from other pages
1. Create and modify [tables of Contents](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Edit.Toc)
1. Learn about Permalinks (UIDs) to ensure links don't break

## Level 4: Docs to C# Source-Code

Here things can get a bit more challenging, which is why we saved this for Level 4.
Basically we'll use the XML-comments in the C# code to generate documentation.

1. Read about [documenting source code](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.SourceCode.Index) and [namespaces](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.SourceCode.Namespaces)

1. Then [Build Docs and Code](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Build.DocsAndCode).

1. As you get better, we suggest reading the [Technical Implementation of the Docs](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Implementation.Index) to understand how everything works.

## Level 5 & 6

...not explained in detail, but you'll find everything you need in the TOC to the left.
