# TOC Customizations

## Normal Navigation / Structure

Most of the TOCs (Table of Contents) are automatically generated by DocFX based on the structure of the markdown files.
This is a bit tricky, but works as expected.

## API Navigation

The TOC for the C# APIs are fairly challenging because the default only offers 2 options:

1. Generate a deep tree structure, where every namespace behaves like a folder (nested)
1. Generate a flat list of all namespaces

Both variants are not very user-friendly, so we've created a special script which enhances the TOC. Our Goals:

1. Most root namespaces are "flattened" so that the initial menu has most of the namespaces visible.
1. Important namespaces are highlighted with emojis.

This is done as follows:

1. The script `/templates/[project]/toc.json.js` is run by docfx when building the API documentation. We customized it to do the following...

1. Retrieve the `build-toc-specs.js` which is a project specific "database" for what we want to customized in this specific project.

1. Run scripts inside the `/templates/[project]/build-toc` folder (these scripts are identical in all projects 🌴/🩸/♾️) to make the following adjustments

    1. Flatten the namespaces we think are important, so they appear in the initial menu

    1. Highlight important namespaces with emojis
