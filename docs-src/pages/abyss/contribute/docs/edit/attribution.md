# Authors and Attribution

In the documentation, we want to give credit to the authors of the content.
This is done by adding a small attribution at the end of each page.

Here is an example:

```markdown
[!include[](~/shared/authors/iJungleboy/_main-author.md)]
```

This will render as:

[!include[](~/shared/authors/iJungleboy/_main-author.md)]

---

## How it Works

All authors which want attribution should

1. create a page in a subfolder of the `shared/authors/` folder.
1. Please follow the existing conventions for the `_main-author.md` file and also for the image which is to be used in the `assets` subfolder.

Note that the `_main-author.md` should be the main author of the page, and other authors may be added later, with a smaller attribution (not specified yet).
