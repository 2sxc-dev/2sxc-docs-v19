# Structure of the Docs Projects

All the projects using this convention have the following folders / structure:

1. `api-docs/` - manually created docs for C# namespaces
1. `api-generated/` - autogenerated docs from the C# code XmlDocs
1. `assets/` - global / reused assets such as the favicon and main logos
    1. `logos/`
        1. `v##/` - logos for specific versions
        1. `vcurrrent/` - logos for the current version, used in layout etc.
    1. `favicon.ico` - favicon for the site
1. `pages/` - where all the content is created
    1. `api/` - the index page for the API documentation
    1. `some-topic/` - a topic with sub-pages
        1. `assets/` - assets used in this topic
        1. `some-sub-topic` - a sub-topic
            1. `assets/` - assets used in this sub-topic
    1. `more-topics/...`... (lots of topics here)
1. `shared/` - shared content like authors, images, etc.
    1. `authors/` - author information for attribution
    1. `.../` - shared/reusable snippets for `!include` statements
1. `templates/`
    1. `[project-name]` - custom html / js / css for this project

> [!TIP]
> This structure is quite flexible and can be adapted to our needs.
> This setup has proven solid and should not be changed without consulting with @iJungleboy.
