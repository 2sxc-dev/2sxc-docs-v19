# Enterprise Dev Workflows

It's really easy to build Apps in 2sxc.
For really advanced scenarios, here some guidance how to make it brilliant.

## Sync Apps from Development to Production

In enterprise scenarios you will have dedicated dev environments.
But the challenge will be how to synchronise changes to the production environment.

👉🏾 See [Sync Apps from Dev to Production](xref:Abyss.EntDev.AppSync)

## Work in Staging-Environment on the Production Server

2sxc has a special feature called **Polymorphism**.
This allows you to prepare and review changes on the production server,
without affecting the users.

👉🏾 See [Polymorphism](xref:Basics.Polymorphism.Index)


## Re-Use App Parts Across Apps & Sites

In multi-site / multi-portal environments,
you may have the scenario where the same App functionality is needed across many sites.

You can

1. Share Content-Types across many different Apps
1. Share Content-Types in the _same_ App in many Sites
1. Share Razor Templates and Assets in the _same_ App in many Sites
1. Share the entire App on many sites

This isn't fully documented yet WIP.
