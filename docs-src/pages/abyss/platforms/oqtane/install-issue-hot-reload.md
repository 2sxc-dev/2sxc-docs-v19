# Problems Installing Apps with Hot Reload Enabled

When using Oqtane in **developer mode** there is a feature called **Hot Reload** which restarts Oqtane when files change.

> [!WARNING]
> Installing Content-Templates and Apps with **Hot Reload** enabled causes problems.
>
> This is because the server will restart a few times during installation of the ZIP.

Because of this you can only install Apps and Content-Templates if **Hot Reload is disabled**.

> [!TIP]
> After installation you can re-enable Hot-Reload as you see fit.

## Checklist to Disable Hot Reload Temporarily

## Background: Hot-Reload Detection

Just FYI in case the error is wrong / surprising. We detect Hot-Reload-Enabled by checking that this DLL is loaded in memory:

* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Watch.BrowserRefresh.dll`

If you believe that we are checking this incorrectly, please open an issue on Github.

## Next Step

* To avoid potential build errors, exclude the `2sxc` folder from the `Oqtane.Server.csproj`. For more details on preventing and resolving these issues, refer to the [Build Oqtane Server Issue](xref:Abyss.Platforms.Oqtane.Install.IssueBuild) documentation.
