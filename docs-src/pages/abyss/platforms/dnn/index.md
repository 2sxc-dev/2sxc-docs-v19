## Upgrade Path

We are very focused on making upgrades easy and pain-free.
Here's what you need to know:

1. You can upgrade 2sxc by installing the latest version on a system which already has 2sxc installed.
1. If you have a version _before_ 8.12, you must first upgrade to 8.12.
1. In general when updating from v9 to v14 there are no expected problems.
1. Before going to v14 you must be running DNN 9.6.1 or newer.
1. In _very rare cases_ you may be affected by [breaking changes](xref:Abyss.Releases.History.AllChanges)

## Features currently not implemented

None, all 2sxc features are available in DNN.
