# Integration into Your Custom Platform (WIP Docs)

EAV and 2sxc can be included as part of your own custom platform or application. 

You may want to do this for things such as:

1. Access existing EAV data which was created in Dnn or Oqtane
1. Use dynamic data to extend the data of your application
1. Use it to extend the functionality of your application

> [!WARNING]
> There docs are work in progress.

## Integration Overview

1. Start with [Scenario 1 - Read EAV Data](xref:Abyss.Integration.Scenario01)

1. Then expand to [Scenario 2 - Edit EAV Data](xref:Abyss.Integration.Scenario01)

1. Then continue with Admin

1. Razor

1. ...



TODO:



5. Provide custom core services as needed

### Necessary for More Complex Scenarios

Depending on your needs, you will activate more functionality in your application:

1. Use Apps with Queries
1. Use Razor Templates to render data
1. Editing in your Web-UI
1. Multi-Site / Tenant implementation
1. Import/Export of data
1. App level WebApi support
1. Image Resizer
1. Global / shared apps
