# 2sxc Release Management

For people who professionaly work with 2sxc it's useful to know how we release it and what the releases mean. 

## General Releases

All our Releases are published here:

1. [Github](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/releases) for Dnn and Oqtane
1. [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=2sxc) for Oqtane releases
1. [Oqtane.net](https://www.oqtane.net/) for Oqtane Auto-Installer

## Release Frequency

2sxc is released an irregular frequencies. 
This can sometimes mean a few releases in a week, and sometimes less than one release per month. 
If this is hard to keep up with and you don't need the latest and greatest, we suggest you stick to the [LTS Releases](xref:Abyss.Releases.Management.PolicyLts)


## LTS Releases (Long Term Support)

Sometimes too much innovation can be scary - which is why we're releasing an LTS (Long Term Support) edition.

## Deprecation Policy

The 2sxc APIs are really, really stable. 
But sometimes we must deprecate old APIs to avoid confusion and to allow better features to replace this. 
We do this in a very controlled manner.
