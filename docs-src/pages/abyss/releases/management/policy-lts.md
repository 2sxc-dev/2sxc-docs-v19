# LTS Policy (Long Term Stable)

Every few months 2sxc is released as an **LTS** version, a.k.a. **Long Term Stable**.
To sync expectations, we want to explain what this means.

> [!TIP]
> LTS for 2sxc means stability and security.

## Meaning of Long-Term-Stable for 2sxc

1. LTS Editions will be receive special support for
    1. at least 3 months after their release
    1. at least till the next LTS is released
1. Special support means
    1. Security fixes
    1. Critical bug fixes

## What it does not mean

LTS Editions will not receive

1. new features
1. new support for new platforms (because this might introduce new risks)
1. non-critical bugfixes - these will be in normal releases, unless someone sponsors a fix

## Volunteer Work

Please remember that 2sxc is free and open-source.
All the work is done by volunteers or by people who are paid by sponsors.
As such, these people will still make the decision if something is deemed critical or not, and who will implement the fix.

If you have a special need and wish to sponsor a fix in either an LTS or any other version, [do contact us](https://2sxc.org/en/contact)
