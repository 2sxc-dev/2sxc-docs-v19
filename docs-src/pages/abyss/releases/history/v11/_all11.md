### Changes Version 11.00

#### Breaking Changes

The following changes are all super-low-profile, but we want to document them just to be through:

1. `DataStream` and `IDataStream` loses a very old property called `.LightList` - we're pretty sure it's not in use anywhere, if you have it, just use `.List` instead.

### Changes Version 11.03 - todo

### Changes Version 11.04 - todo

### Changes Version 11.05

1. Old Edit UI be removed
1. Old Admin-UI be removed
1. APIs which only the old UIs used be removed
1. Old helper JS for AngularJS apps (located in `/js/angularjs`) will be removed from the distribution.
They had not been updated for over 3 years and we believe they were not widely used.
Anybody upgrading will still preserve the files that are there.
If you really need them, download an old release of 2sxc and get them manually.
