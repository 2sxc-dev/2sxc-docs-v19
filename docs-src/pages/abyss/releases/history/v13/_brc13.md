## Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc v13

We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. 
We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this.

### Summary

V13 did some clean-up. It will rarely affect you, but if you are using the TimelineJs App it will.
