## Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc v12

We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. 
We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this.

### Summary

V12 did a lot of internal rework to get it to run on Oqtane. Almost none of the changes will affect you.
