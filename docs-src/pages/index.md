# 2sxc and EAV Docs v19.03.05 LTS

This is the technical documentation for 2sxc and it's parts such as the EAV system.

💡 If you're new to 2sxc, best start with [2sxc.org](https://2sxc.org/).

## 2sxc turns Dnn & Oqtane into a CMS

> [!TIP]
> 2sxc is a CMS- and Meta-Plugin for [Dnn ☢️](xref:Abyss.Platforms.Dnn.Index) and [Oqtane 🩸](xref:Abyss.Platforms.Oqtane.Index).  
> In many ways it's a lot like Elementor for WordPress.

It makes content editing fun and easy, while giving the designer full control.

* So it's an open-source Enterprise Content Management System
* The designer and developer can define fields, layout, relationships and more
* The editor can then create pages, add content, manage images and more without breaking the design

2sxc is used to provide web-site-builder functionality.
It has a simple **Content** mode where users just add images, designed text/image blocks, links etc.
Then there's the sophisticated **App** mode, where users add standalone functional apps like blogs, galleries and more.
Most apps are on GitHub and can be downloaded from the [app-catalog](https://2sxc.org/en/apps).

## 2sxc is a Low-Code Application Framework & CMF

2sxc is also a Low-Code Application Framework and [CMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_frameworks) like Drupal.
So you can extend on existing building blocks to create new functionality, or you can build your own from scratch.

* It's a dynamic data system, where you can define your own data-structures
* It's a very cool EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) data-management system
* It's extensible DataSource system lets you add custom logic and integrate anything
* It's programmable forms allow you to customize the editing experience
* It's a headless REST API.
* It's 1000x more than you think.


## Where to Start

If you are just getting started, then this is probably not where you should be looking. Focus first on:

1. The [Basics](xref:Basics.Index) which tells you about Architecture, Data Models and more
1. Content on [2sxc.org](https://2sxc.org/) like the [learn section](https://2sxc.org/en/learn)
1. Apps on [2sxc Catalog](https://2sxc.org/en/apps) which contains many ready-to-use apps like blogs and news, as well as tutorials
1. The [Dnn Tutorials](https://2sxc.org/dnn-tutorials/en/) on 2sxc.org

👉 With this knowledge, you can already create amazing stuff.

2sxc is very flexible and can be used for almost any kind of content-management needs or app development needs.
Because of this, different documentations help you work with different things.
Here's the overview:

1. [Many solutions and recommendations](http://2sxc.org/en/blog) are found in the _Blog_ on 2sxc.org
1. [Many demo, template and tutorial Apps](http://2sxc.org/en/Apps) are found in the _App Catalog_ on 2sxc.org
1. [2sxc / EAV Roadmap](xref:Abyss.Releases.Roadmap)
