# Content Assets / Images / Documents

[!include[](../stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .data-assets-entities { visibility: visible; } </style>

Content has Assets like **images** and **documents**. 

## Private Assets

By default, all Assets _belong_ to the item and field they were uploaded on. This happens automatically and is managed by [ADAM](xref:Basics.Cms.Adam.Index).

## Shared Assets

You can also have shared assets which are stored in the Site content folder, but we don't recommend this as it makes clean-up very difficult.
