# CSS in the Browser

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .show-html { visibility: visible; } </style>

The **Css** which the browser receives can come from multiple sources:

1. **[App Assets](xref:Basics.App.FoldersAndFiles.Assets)** located in your App folder

1. [Polymorphism](xref:Basics.Polymorphism.Index) where you have multiple templates for each kind of CSS framework
1. Use [Koi](xref:NetCode.Koi.Index) to detect the CSS framework and apply different CSS classes based on the CSS Framework
