# HTML in the Browser

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .show-html { visibility: visible; } </style>

The **HTML** which the browser receives comes directly from your [Razor](xref:NetCode.Razor.Index) or [Token](xref:Basics.Server.Render.Tokens.Index) templates. 
You have 100% control over the HTML which is generated, 2sxc does not get in your way. 

There's not much to add to that ðŸ˜‰.
