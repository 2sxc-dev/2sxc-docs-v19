## The basics

* **Features** are global aspects in 2sxc which can be _activated_ or also _disabled_ by configuration.
* Some features are enabled by default, others are disabled by default.
* Some features may affect security. This information is shown in the admin UI.
* Some features require a license to be activated.
* **Licenses** are keys which _allow_ the use of _advanced_ features.
* Some features are automatically activated when a license is activated, but can be disabled.
