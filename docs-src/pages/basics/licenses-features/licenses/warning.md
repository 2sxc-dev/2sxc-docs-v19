# Warning: Registration is Invalid

After a major upgrade you may see a message similar to this:

<img src="./assets/warning-license-invalid-v15.jpg" class="full-width">

or this:

<img src="./assets/warning-license-invalid-v16.jpg" class="full-width">

The message appears, because

1. The system has one or more license files
1. None of them are valid for the current system

As a result, any special features which are licensed / activated will be disabled.
The reason is that a license file was installed for a previous version of 2sxc, and must be upgraded to the new version.

## Background

2sxc uses licenses to activate special features.
These licenses are usually system-bound, meaning that they are activated for a specific system.
This is done by generating a fingerprint of the system, and then activating the license for that fingerprint.

Since 2sxc does not communicate with the license server, it cannot know if the license is valid for the current system.
So it uses a security hash which also contains the major version of 2sxc, requiring you to upgrade the license when you upgrade 2sxc.

## How to Fix

Just [re-register your system using patrons](xref:Basics.LnF.Licenses.Index).
