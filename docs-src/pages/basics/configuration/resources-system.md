<style>.context-box-summary .data-configuration { visibility: visible; }</style>

_Note: The System Resources feature is new in 12.04 so only a few settings are predefined as of now. This will expand in future releases._

> Remember you can create any other settings on your own `Resources` ContentType


## Predefined System Resources as of 2sxc 12.04

_As of now there are none, the API was just ensured to already be consistent with Settings_

## Conventions used in System Resources

The built-in system settings are meant to carry hundreds of settings. To enable that, the structure is always as follows:

1. Every topic - like `Help` will have an own configuration ContentType
1. All the names of these will probably start with the emoji "üåê" so the ContentType will have a name like `üåêHelp`
1. It should always have a field called `SettingsIdentifier` repeating the name like `Help`
1. All of these fields should have an empty-state (like empty string, not-set-number) etc.
1. ... `Items` and ... `ItemIdentifier`
