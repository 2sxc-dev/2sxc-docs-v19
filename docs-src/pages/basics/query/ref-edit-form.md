# Use Queries in Edit-UI Dropdowns

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .query-app, .context-box-summary .process-headless { visibility: visible; } </style>

Dropdown fields (Related-Entity or String) in the Edit-Form can be configured to show values from a Query. 

They can also be cascaded - so that a selection on one dropdown changes the list of possible items on another dropdown.
