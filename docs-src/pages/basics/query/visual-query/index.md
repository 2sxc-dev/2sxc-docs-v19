# VisualQuery Designer

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .query-app { visibility: visible; } </style>

2sxc includes a visual designer for creating queries called **VisualQuery**. It's drag-and drop, and each component can be configured to your needs. 

## The Designer

This is what it looks like:

<img src="./assets/basic-visual-query.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

This is what you see when you run a query:

<img src="./assets/basic-query-results.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">


## Add Parts / DataSources

Just add parts to your query as you need them: 

<img src="./assets/designer-add-datasource.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

...and drag them around for positioning as you want:

<img src="./assets/designer-drag-parts.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

## Connect Parts / DataSources

Now just connect [Out Streams](xref:Basics.Query.Streams.Out) of some parts to the [In Streams](xref:Basics.Query.Streams.In) on other parts:

<img src="./assets/designer-drag-connection.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

In some cases, the connection to drop unto already has the right name, otherwise just click on the name to rename it:

<img src="./assets/designer-rename-connection.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

> [!TIP]
> Renaming connections can be very important, as the receiver of data may expect a specifically named [In Stream](xref:Basics.Query.Streams.In) to bring it data. The most common name is `Default` BTW.

You can also rename the Outbound connection if you want this:

<img src="./assets/designer-rename-out.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

> [!TIP]
> Just like the In-Streams, the [Out-Streams](xref:Basics.Query.Streams.Out) names can have an important effect. In the example above, renaming the Out means that the shown **App DataSource** will only give data of the type `Company` on this stream.


## Save, Run and Debug

Here's an example of the result after running the query shown above:

<img src="./assets/designer-after-run.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

As you can see, the designer shows each connection and how much data was in it (and you'll see a dialog showing the data). If we click on a stream we can also see exactly what was in the stream:

<img src="./assets/data-of-stream.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

Read more about this in [](xref:Basics.Query.Debug.Index).

## Add more DataSources and Connect

To build your dream-query, add more parts as you need them...

<img src="./assets/add-more-datasources.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

As you can see, the resulting stream has 0 items in it. Let's configure the Item-ID Filter to do something usefull:


## Configure the Parts

All parts which can be configured show a gear-icon when you mouse over them:

<img src="./assets/configure-datasource.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

...which then show a dialog for this specific DataSource:

<img src="./assets/configure-entity-id-filter.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">
