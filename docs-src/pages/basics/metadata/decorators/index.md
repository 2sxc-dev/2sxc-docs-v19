# Metadata Decorators - (advanced âš )

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .data-all { visibility: visible; } </style>

**Metadata Decorators** are system [Metadata](xref:Basics.Metadata.Index) which enhance the configuration of something. 

Examples

* the `IsDefault` Decorator can be used to set a view to being the default, even if it's not the first one in alphabetical order
* the `IsShared` marks Apps so they can be inherited in other sites
* the `Requirement` marks the `IsShared` so it's only available if feature & license are enabled

## Special Notes

Some decorators have no field, as adding the decorator already contains all the information necessary. 

By default, 2sxc would not save empty data, so to enable this, these Decorators must themselves have a `SaveEmpty` Decorator.
