## What is a Content-Type Scope?

Content-Types have a _Scope_. This is like a category for the Content-Type. 

> Normally you only see the Content-Types and Entities of the default Scope. 

The other Scopes have internal and system Content-Types like `@String`. 

* [Here's the full list of current Scopes](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/LqblhYXD)

## Switch Scopes

Just use the built-in scope switcher like this:

For older versions see this checklist on how to [switch Scopes](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/MEa0dtBw) to manage data of other Scopes

## Nice to Know about Scopes

You can easily create your own scope at any time. This is usually used for [](xref:Basics.Data.ContentTypes.Global) or if your App is getting really complex and has so many Content-Types that it confuses the Admin.
