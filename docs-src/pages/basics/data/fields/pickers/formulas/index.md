# Picker Formulas (new v18)

Formulas are a powerful way to create dynamic sources for pickers.

👉🏾 see also [Formulas](xref:Basics.Edit.Formulas.Index)

With Pickers, formulas are a bit more complex, since they can be used for:

1. Changing what is selected
1. Changing what the options are
1. Changing additional aspects of options, such as tooltips, disabled-state and more.

This is still WIP and will be documented as it's developed.
