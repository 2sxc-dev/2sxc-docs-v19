# Field Input-Type **string-url-path**

Use this field type to manage url-paths which you'll usually use to identify an
item. For example, if you have a blog and each post has a url with the name, this is the field that you need to match the url to the item. It stores a [string/text data](xref:Basics.Data.Fields.String). It's an extension of the basic [string field type](xref:Basics.Data.Fields.String).

## Features 

1. ensure that only url-safe characters are used
1. automatically generate a url based on one or many other fields when editing the first time
1. keeps the generated url stable later on
1. also allows manual editing if needed

## Configuring a String-Url-Path

This shows the configuration dialog:

* **Auto Generate...** here you can build a template how the url should be auto-generated
* **Allow Slashes** this let's you choose if slashes are desired in this url-fragment - in most cases you don't want slashes
