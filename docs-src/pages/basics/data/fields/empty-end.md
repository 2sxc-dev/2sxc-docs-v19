# Field Input-Type **empty-end**

Use this field type for closing a field-group. 
It's an extension of the basic [empty field type](xref:Basics.Data.Fields.Empty).

> [!TIP]
> Note that all field groups close automatically if another field group start afterwards. You only need the `empty-end` to close a group when you want the following fields to be in the normal / main group again. 

## Features 

1. Closes a previously opened field-group

## Configuring a Empty-Default

_there is nothing to configure on this field - even the title will not be used for anything_

## History

1. Introduced in 2sxc 12.01
