# Images Guide (Best Practices & Code)

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>  .context-box-summary .image-resizer    { visibility: visible; } </style>

Images are a crucial part of every website and CMS. We want to be sure that:

1. **Perfect Editing**
    1. Editors can easily add images
    1. Editors can give titles to images
    1. Editors can have some control over how the image is shown - but not too much, it must be within the restrictions of the design
1. **Perfect Output**
    1. Images look great no matter what the editor does
    1. Images are accessible (for people with disabilities, etc.)
    1. Images use the latest possible file formats
    1. Images load quickly - which also requires images to be the best-possible size
1. **Perfect SEO & Page Speed**
    1. Images are optimized for search engines
    1. Images are optimized for page speed, especially mobile page speed
1. **Pefect Control by the Designer**
    1. The designer determines how images should look in various scenarios

## Part 1: Edit UI / UX

The Edit UI presents various options to the user for uploading and configuring images.

It's important to note that v13.10+ has a new feature to let the user customize what part of the image is really important (what corner/edge).
This is important in scenarios where a resize would otherwise always show the middle, which may not be appropriate.

Since this feature will only affect the output if the Razor template uses the [IImageService](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Services.IImageService),
the designer must activate it on the field. Otherwise the feature is not available.

<img src="./assets/image-configuration.jpg" class="full-width" width="100%">

**Important**: The config-button is only available...

<!-- 1. ...IF it has been enabled -->
1. If the Razor template uses the automatic APIs to render the image
    1. When using the new Typed code, using the `something.Img("Image")` API (see [Img(...)](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.ITypedItem.Img*) and [Picture(...)](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.ITypedItem.Picture*))
    1. or using the [IImageService](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Services.IImageService) (older way)
1. ...and IF the file is an image
1. ...and IF the file "belongs" to the item being edited  
    _If the file is a general file from another item or from the root folder, the metadata is not available._
    _This is important because files from elsewhere could be shared, and editing the metadata could have unexpected side-effects._

## Part 2: Image Metadata

When a user edits the image settings in the UI, the data is stored as [metadata](xref:Basics.Metadata.Index) for this image.
This is important, because generating a perfect `<img>` or `<picture>` tag requires this information.

## Part 3: Razor Code to Generate HTML for Images

### Part 3a: Modern Typed Code

When using modern typed code, the object containing the data is an [ITypedItem](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.ITypedItem)
or something which inherits from it.
In this case, the API will take care of almost everything.
Just use one of these methods to create the HTML:

* `thing.Img("Image")` - for a simple `<img>` tag
* `thing.Picture("Image")` - for a `<picture>` tag

### Part 3b: Legacy Code (older APIs)

The older API used the [IImageService](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Services.IImageService) to generate the HTML.
This in turn needed a [IField](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.IField) object to figure out what to do.

#### Part 3b Legacy Code - Dynamic Field

If a content item stores the image on a property `.Image` then something like `Content.Image` would return `/Portal/0/Adam/some-image.jpg`.
In this case, the [IImageService](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Services.IImageService) cannot find the metadata.

This is why we need to give it the entire field, not just the value. This is done using `Content.Field("Image")`
and will get your code a [IDynamicField](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.IField).

#### Part 3b Legacy Code - ImageService

The [IImageService](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Services.IImageService) will take all the known information and generate an `<img>` or a `<picture>` tag.

This can be used in its default implementation just using `.Img(Content.Field)` or `.Picture(...)`.
In this case is uses the default `Content` settings (see below).

If you need more control, there are 3 options:

1. The `Img(...)` command has many more parameters for common scenarios such as using other settings, factor, imgAlt or imgClass
1. You can also generate very custom settings using the `.Settings(...)` command on the ImageService
1. You can also take the resulting object like `var img = imgSvc.Img(Content.Image)` and use it to generate the final tag yourself.

## Part 4: Settings and Recipes

**Settings** are pre configured parameters how the image is to be resized.
They are stored at App, Site, Global or Preset level.

By default the configuration called `Content` is used for images in the Content of the page.
Other settings also exist, such as `Lightbox` or `Screen`.
You can also create your own configurations, such as `PersonProfile`.

üëâüèº Read more about [Image Settings](xref:Basics.Configuration.Settings.Images.Index)

In your Razor code you can create new settings or modify existing ones using the `.Setting(...)` command on the ImageService.

* To create settings based on the `Content` use `.Setting("Content", ...)`
* To create brand new settings, use `.Setting(false, ...)`

**Recipes** define what variants of the image should be generated for other sizes, as well as other parameters to use when generating `img` or `picture` tags.
The initial configuration is also stored in the settings and will be used, unless you specify something different.

üëâüèº Read more about [Image Recipes](xref:Basics.Configuration.Settings.Images.Recipes)

You can also generate your own recipes:

* create a new recipe like this: `.Recipe("2x, 3x")` - this is only meant to create a quick recipe with a few variants.
* inherit/expand an existing recipe like this: `.Recipe(originalRecipe, ...)`


## Good to Know: Link.Image(...) API

In the rare cases where you just need a URL and not the full HTML, check out the [Link.Image(...) API](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.Objects.Link.Image).

It is not as powerful as the ImageService but if you only need a URL it may be what you need.
