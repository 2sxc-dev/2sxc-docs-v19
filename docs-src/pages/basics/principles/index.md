# 2sxc Principles and Values

To make a large system such as 2sxc easy and consistent, we need guiding principles and values.

If you create solutions with 2sxc, it's good to know these.
If you help us create 2sxc, you must know these.

## Systems Design Principles

### Separation of Roles

We usually differentiate between the Content-Editor, the Web-Designer and the Developer. Each have a unique skill set and unique needs, which you can address perfectly with 2sxc.

### Separation of Concerns

Content, data, layout, functionality, business-logic - all these shouldn't be mixed.

### Stay out of the way

2sxc helps you do amazing things - with other existing technologies and tools.
So 2sxc does many important things for you, but it mainly helps you leverage other technologies like HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, knockoutJS, AngularJS, bootstrap etc.

### Keep things simple

Managing content is very complex and time consuming.
And we want to help your content-editor to focus on that, and not on technical implementations.

### Reusability

Things we or you create with 2sxc are very easy to adapt to other use cases.


## Values

### Open-Source

We keep our work open, create demo-apps and write blogs.
All for free. Please give back, contribute to the community with your own Apps and blogs on how you leverage 2sxc.
