2sxc is great both for providing data to **Native Mobile Apps** as well as for creating **PWAs** and **Mobile Web Apps**.

## Native Mobile Apps

If you have a Native Mobile App for Android or iOS and need to get either 2sxc Data or Dnn Data to that App, you should check out:

1. [Headless Web APIs](xref:WebApi.Headless.Index)
1. [Custom WebAPIs](xref:NetCode.WebApi.Index)

## Web Server Hosted PWA

**PWA**s or [Progressive Web Apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application) are technically web pages which look and behave like Native Apps. 
2sxc is great for creating this and we've created our first PWAs in 2014.
