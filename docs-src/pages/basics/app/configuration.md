# App Configuration

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .data-configuration { visibility: visible; }</style>

Every App has a **Configuration** Entity which describes things like

1. App Name
1. App Version
1. Folder (within the 2sxc-folder)
1. Minimum version of Dnn needed for the App to work
1. Minimum version of 2sxc needed for the App to work
1. etc.

## Edit App Configuration

This is where you can find the App Configuration

On **2** you can configure the permissions you need:

1. **Display Name**  
  The name shown in the app-picker for the content-editor. It is also used to name the ZIP-package if you ever export the app.
1. **Description** 
  Just an informative description
1. **Version**  
  A version number, will also be used in the package-name when exporting
1. **Folder**  
  The folder within the [portal]/2sxc/ where all the templates, javascripts and other assets are stored. If you touch this, remember to rename the folder as well. 
1. **Allow Token Templates**  
  Just a yes/no if these are allowed in this package. At the moment it has no effect, just for your own information. At a later time it may prevent certain templates from working if disabled. 
1. **Allow Razor Templates**  
  Same as Allow Token Templates.
1. **Original Id**  
  A (optional) guid of the original App which was used to generate this current App. This is only important, if you reset the App-Guid when exporting it; it will help show the correct Getting-Started in the App even if the App-Guid was reset. 
1. **Required Version (added in 08.03.03)**  
  Is used to check if the app can run, or otherwise warn the user. It will use the .net version compare.  
  _Example value: "08.03.00"_
1. **Required DNN Version (added in 08.03.03)**  
  Is used to check if the app can run, or otherwise warn the user. It will use the .net version compare.  
  _Example value: "07.02.00"_


## Difference App Configuration / App Settings

The [](xref:Basics.App.Configuration) is a system Entity and 2sxc needs it for the App to work properly. 

The [](xref:Basics.App.Settings) can contain any information you configure it to have, and the values are only used in the App itself. 

## Use in C# Code (Razor / WebAPI)

Most of this information is available on the `App` object, like `App.Path`. Read about the [C# API here](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.Objects.App.Index).
