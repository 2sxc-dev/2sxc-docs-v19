# 2sxc Auto-Translate Overview (new v15)

2sxc 15 adds a new feature to automatically translate content in the Edit UI.
Here's what you need to know.

## Patrons Only Feature

This is a patrons only feature.
To use this feature, need the license [**Patrons Advanced CMS**](xref:2sxc Auto-Translate Overview).
[See activation instructions](xref:Basics.LnF.Licenses.Index).

## Auto Translate uses Google Translate

Auto Translate uses the [Google Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate).
It is available in the Edit UI.
This way the editor can run auto-translate, optimize the results and save.
This requires a [Google API key](xref:Basics.Languages.AutoTranslate.ApiKey) for each site.

## Auto Translate User Experience

The user can choose to auto-translate a _single field_ or _all fields_.

<div class="float-container">
  <img src="./assets/auto-translate-all-menu.jpg" width="45%" class="float-end glow">
  <img src="./assets/auto-translate-original.jpg" width="45%" class="float-start glow">
</div>


After this, the user must select what source language should be used.
The UI will show you how many fields of the available source languages have content.

<div class="float-container">
  <img src="./assets/auto-translate-all-dialog-many-sources.jpg" width="45%" class="float-end glow">
  <img src="./assets/auto-translate-all-dialog.jpg" width="45%" class="float-start glow">
</div>

In the end you'll get the result for further editing.

<div class="float-container">
  <img src="./assets/auto-translate-all-result-ar.jpg" width="45%" class="float-end glow">
  <img src="./assets/auto-translate-all-result-de.jpg" width="45%" class="float-start glow">
</div>



## HTML and Unknown Content are Preserved

Google Translate will preserve anything it can't translate - such as names (if it can tell it's a name)
as well as HTML formatting.

## Not all Fields are Auto-Translated

Some fields are not auto-translated - either by default, or by configuration.

* Some fields will not be translated by default
  * Fields which can't be translated - such as entity-pickers
  * Fields which don't make sense to translate - eg. Numbers, Links, GPS coordinates
* Some fields are configured to not translate  
  _this can be configured at the field level_
  * Name fields should be configured to not translate
  * Address fields (street, city, etc.) should be configured to not translate
* Some fields were already translated manually, and will not auto-translate  
  _this is to prevent manual translations from being overwritten_

Fields which are not auto-translated will keep their previous status - in most cases locked (auto-inherit).

To configure a field to not auto-translate, you can do this here:

## FAQ

1. **Q: Is it possible to just auto-translate at runtime?**  
  A: Fully automatic translate at runtime is not useful so this is not what the feature does.
