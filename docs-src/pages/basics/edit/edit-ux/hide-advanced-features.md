# Hide Advanced Features From Non-Admins

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .browser-edit { visibility: visible; }</style>

For many users 2sxc is too powerful, so there are various mechanisms for hiding the complexity from normal editors.

## Overview

1. You can _auto-hide_ all advanced toolbar buttons using a special security group.
2. You can create _custom toolbars_ for all users, or even for certain user groups inside a Razor template
3. You can see even more advanced stuff by going into a special _developer mode_
4. You can see more internal code and messages by loading the JS-Code unminified

## Auto-Hide Advanced Buttons From Non-Admins

This is very simple - 2sxc asks Dnn if there is a security group called **2sxc Designers**. If such a group exists, then only users in that group (and all host-users) see the advanced button, any other user will not see advanced buttons any more. You can find more [instructions in this 2sxc Designers checklist](xref:Checklist.AdminsNoAdvFeatures).

## Custom Toolbars

You can create any kind of toolbar, and you can decide to show/hide which ever you want based on security roles in Dnn. This requires standard C# / Razor skills and is not explained more in detail right now.

Note that you'll find some snippets which should help you in the snippets, to both check what group a user is in, and to generate various custom toolbars.
