# 2sxc Docs Version Hub

This page is a hub to all the documentation versions.
It should help users find older/newer versions of the documentation.

This page was created 2023-11 and is still WIP.
As of now, there is only 1 documentation which is the latest,
but future releases will start creating separated documentations.
