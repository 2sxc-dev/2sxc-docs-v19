Every [VisualQuery](xref:Basics.Query.VisualQuery.Index) you create has a REST URL. If you set the permissions, you can then read from the Query through REST. You can also pass query-parameters in the URL. Queries are Read APIs.

## Standard Query Calls

The Query endpoint can be accessed on

* `.../app/auto/query/[your-query-name]` when you're accessing a query of the current App (from a dnn-page with this module), as then 2sxc uses auto-detect
* `.../app/[app-folder]/query/[your-query-name]` using this endpoint from external (other module, other page, other website) as then auto-detect can't work.

## Read Only Certain Streams

A query may have many streams that your client may not necessarily need. To limit the results to only specific streams, add the stream name to the url, like this:

`.../app/auto/query/[your-query-name]/Default`

## HTTP GET only

Note that Query endpoints only support the http-verb GET.

## Naming Recommendations

As the query-name is used in the path it's best-practice to use query-names without spaces and special characters. You can get it to work even with such specials, but we recommend you don't do that for simplicity. 

## POST with GUID filter (WIP)

In 2sxc 11.20 we're experimenting with a post-access to the query which will allow you to also specify GUIDs to filter. This is not final yet. 

## Setting Security

Querying a query requires read-permissions on that query.
