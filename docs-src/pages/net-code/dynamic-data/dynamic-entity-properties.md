# Dynamic Entity Properties

Whenever you create a content-type - like _Person_ - and want to work with the data in your C# Razor templates, you'll be working with a _Dynamic Entity_.
You can get any value using one of the following:

* the dot-notation like `Content.FirstName`
* the `Get()` method like `Content.Get("FirstName")`
* the `Get()` method with a fallback value like `Content.Get("FirstName", fallback: "John")`
* the typed `Get<T>()` method like `Content.Get<string>("FirstName")`

## What Dynamic Entity really does - and how

Technically the dynamic entity object is like a read-helper for the more complex [](xref:ToSic.Eav.Data.IEntity). So actually the _dynamic entity_ object will keep a reference to the underlying read-only `IEntity` item on a property `Entity`, and whenever your code accesses a property, the dynamic entity will query it from the underlying `Entity`.

The main things that the _dynamic entity_ does for you, are

1. Give you a nice, short syntax to access a property - so `Content.FirstName` instead of `Object.Attributes["FirstName"]["en"]` which would be necessary using the more advanced `IEntity` object
2. Ensure that the language used in retrieving a value is the current user language
3. Give conveniant access to related information like the `Presentation` object
4. Automatically handle some data-not-found errors
5. Automatically do conversions, like convert related entities (like `.Children`) into dynamic objects to make your code more consistant  

## How the Property Lookup Works

Internally there are a few things that can returned if you do something like `Content.SomeProperty`

1. If the `SomeProperty` is one of the internal properties like `EntityId` etc. (see below) this will be returned
1. Next is a simple property of the underlying Entity,
    1. like `FirstName` which would be a string
    1. or a relationship property like `Tags` which will return a special DynamicEntity that behaves as a list (see below)
1. Last but not least - if nothing matches, it's `null`

## Properties of a Dynamic Entity

Read the API docs in the [](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicEntity).

Additional properties that work (they are dynamic, so don't appear in the code)

1. **EntityId** _int_
1. **EntityGuid** _Guid_
1. **EntityType** _string_ - the type name like _Person_
1. **IsPublished** _bool_ - true/false if this item is currently published
1. **_AnyProperty_** _dynamic, but actually bool | string | decimal | datetime | List<DynamicEntity>_ any normal property of the content-item can be accessd directly. It's correctly .net typed (string, etc.)

> [!TIP]
> In 2sxc 10.27 any property that returns a `List<DynamicEntity>` now returns a [](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicEntity) containing a list.
> This means that if you expect the list to just return one item, you can directly access its properties like this:  
> `Content.Author.FirstName`.  
> To otherwise enumerate the items, we recommend [](xref:Custom.Hybrid.Razor12.AsList(System.Object)) so `AsList(Content.Tags)`

## Appendix

The following properties/methods exist, but shouldn't be used. They are documented here so that you know that they are not meant for public use:

1. Created - the created date
1. Modified - the modified date
1. Owner - the current owner of the item, usually the author
1. Metadadata - currently use `AsEntity(theObject).Metadata`
1. Permissions - permissions of the current item (if any are defined)
