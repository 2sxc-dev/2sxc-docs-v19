This is the newest base class and recommended to use.
It provides you the full typed API such as the `MyItem` object and `AsItem(...)` methods.

Differences to previous versions:

* Typed API
* The root `Edit` object was removed, as it's primary purpose was to provide toolbars, for which you should use the `Kit.Toolbar` service instead.  
  If you still need the `Edit` object, you can find it on `Kit.Edit`.
