# 2sic Library (ToSic.Lib)

The innermost core of 2sic code is `ToSic.Lib` - a library of classes and methods which are used by all other parts of 2sxc.

This is a very technical documentation meant for developers of 2sxc or other developers who want to understand the inner workings of 2sxc.

The **Lib** has the following concerns

* Dependency Injection
* Logging
* Helpers
