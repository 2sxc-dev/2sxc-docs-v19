# Razor: Rendering Content-Blocks

When using [Inner Content](xref:Basics.Cms.InnerContent.Index) the linked content-blocks (apps or pieces of content) must be rendered into the template. Here's how to do it in Razor. 

[!include["Razor Tutorials"](~/shared/tutorials/razor.md)]


## How to use

There are two common use cases

1. Virtual Panes at item level - in this case, the item has it's own pane for placing apps and content-blocks
2. Very Rich Text - where you add content-blocks and apps in the WYSIWYG

## Item-Level Virtual Panes
Here's a quick example which renders an area with all content-blocks: 

```razor
@ToSic.Sxc.Block.Render.All(Content, field: "InnerContent")
```

This example creates the area for the content-blocks (important so that the UI appears for editors to add more blocks) and renders all existing content-blocks in the predefined order into that area. 

Here's a more manual example of doing the same thing, but done manually to demonstrate what happens and to allow myself to add more css-classes: 

```html
<div class="some-class sc-content-block-list" @Edit.ContextAttributes(post, field: "DesignedContent")>
    @foreach(var cb in @post.DesignedContent) {
        @cb.Render();
    }
</div>
```
If you care about doing it manually, read more about the [Edit object](xref:NetCode.Razor.Edit).

## Very Rich Text / Inner-Content

Here's an example how to merge content-blocks with a html-text which has placeholders for each content-block, allowing a mix of text/apps. 

```razor
@ToSic.Sxc.Blocks.Render.All(post, field: "WysiwygContent", merge: post.Body)
```

There is a new parameter merge, where you fill in your WYSIWYG-field that contains the content-block(s).
