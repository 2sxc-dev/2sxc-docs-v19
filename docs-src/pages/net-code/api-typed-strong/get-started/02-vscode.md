This will guide you to configure **VS Code** so you can have Intellisense.
This will make it much easier and make you more productive.

## 1. Setup VS Code

ðŸ‘‰ Check out the [VS Code Setup Docs](xref:Guides.VsCode.Index)

## 2. Verify it Works

1. Make sure you restart VS Code after you've made the changes

Open the file `UseHelper.cshtml` we just created and hover over the `MyHelper` as well as the `Hello` method. You should see the IntelliSense pop up.
